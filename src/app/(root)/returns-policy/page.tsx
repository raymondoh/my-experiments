            <h2>Our Return Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately, we
              canâ€™t offer you a refund or exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It
              must also be in the original packaging.
            </p>

            <h2>Return Process</h2>
            <p>To initiate a return, please follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Contact us at <strong>info@motostix.com</strong> with your order number and the reason for your return.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once your return is approved, we will provide you with a return authorization and shipping instructions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Package the item securely and ship it to the address we provide. Please note that you will be
                responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received
              your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to
              your original method of payment within a certain amount of days (typically 5-10 business days).
            </p>
