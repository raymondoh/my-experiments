### Stripe Price to Tier Mapping

Stripe price IDs are mapped to internal subscription tiers through the `PRICE_TO_TIER` helper. Set the following environment variables to link your Stripe prices to the `pro` and `business` tiers:

- `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` and `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID_YEARLY`
- `STRIPE_BUSINESS_PRICE_ID` and `STRIPE_BUSINESS_PRICE_ID_YEARLY`

Checkout sessions use these values to resolve which tier a customer is subscribing to. Missing or incorrect IDs will cause checkout requests to fail.
